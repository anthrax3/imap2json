# mail.json design

<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20513041/json-design-best-practices>

Initially we started with a key based design, so that mail UIDs can be easily
looked up, and with a special THREAD entry which described the thread structure
of the UIDs. For example: <https://github.com/kaihendry/imap2json/blob/cf0d6ff6795aca6245edfb86294507d7e621fba8/mail.json>

Pros:

* Individual emails are quick to look up
* THREAD is exposed, so comparing that THREAD data structure with subsequent fetches should make it bandwidth efficient to keep mail.json current

Cons:

* Thread has to be built from THREAD array description
* Missing hash identifier of the thread, could be put in, but how?
* Since not an array structure, it can't be mapped easily to a handlebars template

# Array based structure

The id is bashed on the sha1sum of the first message in the conversation:

	{
	[ id: 3ae0abbf831db579a23212457dbfac8afd95e2d8,
	  mails: [{ header: ..., body:...},  { header: ..., body:...} { header: ..., body:...}]
	],
	[ id: c7e7d24d6c944d3e518a44eacc3bbea8a1b78ffe,
	  mails: [{ header: ..., body:...},  { header: ..., body:...} { header: ..., body:...}]
	],
	[ id: 84dd030a09654a4d187a4bb9396725b0b601cd67,
	  mails: [{ header: ..., body:...},  { header: ..., body:...} { header: ..., body:...}]
	],

Pros:

* Trivial to render
* Has each conversation uniquely identified

Cons:

* Is it easy to expand / lookup a short sha1sum, e.g. '3ae0' to '3ae0abbf831db579a23212457dbfac8afd95e2d8'?
* We are not storing THREAD which is needed to easily know what we have already
* This structure doesn't consider the subtle nesting in the thread, it just groups the conversation, losing that information
* Seems more of a display format
